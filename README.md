## Iris-Recognition

# Intent of the Project
A simulation based project which analyses a set of NIR(Near-Infra-Red) greyscale images obtained from the CASIA(Chines Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation) database. Based on the assumption that the system is working in a scenario, in which a user would use his authentication ID, such as ID card, unique login data, in order to prepare the system to compare the input data against the user's data from the database. 
As this is a simulation based project, system works with only a certain type of images, and the algorithm is tuned to detect only these type of images. OpenCV library is used as to leverage image processing algorithms and created the application entirely in C++.
